<p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education refers to the use of machine learning algorithms and
                    intelligent systems to create adaptive and personalised learning experiences. AI algorithms can
                    analyse vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and trends to develop effective learning
                    strategies.
                </p>
<p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    Data and analytics focus on collecting and analysing educational data, including a students learning
                    activities, engagement levels, and learning outcomes. Analytics provide teachers with valuable
                    insights into the learning process, enabling evidence-based decision-making to support learning.
                </p>
<p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    AI, data, and analytics work together symbiotically, but they can also function independently. A
                    system using AI may not necessarily gather data on a students learning, and a system focused on data
                    analytics may not leverage AI. When combined, AI and analytics can create highly optimised teaching
                    and learning processes.

<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
<li>Understand the concept of machine learning.</li>
<li>Recognise when and how to use AI, data, and analytics to benefit learning. Also, understand
                            the tools that use them, being careful to avoid any detrimental effects.</li>
<li>Understand the fundamental principles of technical functionality, including the basic
