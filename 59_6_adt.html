                    José Luis decides to embark on an ambitious project with his students: constructing and programming robots from
                    a kit provided by the recent grant. Initially, José Luis had doubts about the relevance of coding in his curriculum
                    and its perceived complexity. He worried that the abstract nature of coding might disengage his students, particularly
                    those who struggle with math.
                </p>
<p class="mb-4">
                    Despite his reservations, José Luis decides to proceed with the project. He leads his students through the assembly
                    of the robots and introduces them to a user-friendly coding platform. This platform enables the students to animate
                    their robots with various movements and tasks. To José Luis’s astonishment, the project ignites a spark of enthusiasm
                    among the students. Some students prefer building the robots; others love to make the robots their performance circuits
                    from cardboard. Students eagerly apply coding to direct their robots in very simple activities such as line-following
                    and obstacle navigation. Eventually, they create a robot performance accuracy competition in student groups, where groups
                    can name their robot and develop their secret performance code.
                </p>
<p>
                    As the project unfolds, José Luis observes a seamless blend of the physical and digital worlds, revealing
                    the intricate layers of robotics. The endeavour brings forth a wave of creativity and problem-solving skills, particularly
                    from students who typically find maths challenging. José Luis comes to a valuable realisation: the importance
                    of embracing mistakes as learning opportunities. He discovers that coding is not just a tool for teaching
                    maths and logic; it’s a creative and enjoyable pathway to try out new ideas.
