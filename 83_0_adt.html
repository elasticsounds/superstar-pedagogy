<h3 aria-label="Subsection: Learning Design" class="font-bold text-lg mb-1" data-aria-id="aria-83-0-3" tabindex="0">Learning Design</h3>
<p>Learning design is the process of making informed decisions about the various elements that go into
                    creating effective and engaging learning experiences for learners, based on educational theory and 
                    the science of how people learn. It involves choosing the content, structure, sequence, activities, strategies, 
                    assessments, and technology that support learning. An important aspect of learning design is to facilitate
                    inclusive education by creating a Universal Design for Learning (UDL).</p>
<h3 aria-label="Subsection: Maker Learning/Education" class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-1" data-aria-id="aria-83-0-4" tabindex="0">Maker Learning/Education</h3>
<p>Maker education offers a transformational approach to teaching and learning that positions agency
                    and student interest at the centre, asking students to become more aware of the design of the world
                    around them, and to begin to see themselves as people who can tinker, hack and improve that design. Often,
                    coding education is linked with the Maker movement, as well as the interdisciplinary views of science, 
                    technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM).</p>
<h3 aria-label="Subsection: Mobile Learning" class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-1" data-aria-id="aria-83-0-5" tabindex="0">Mobile Learning</h3>
<p>Mobile learning had its peak during the last decade, but still it is evident that handheld and other
                    evolving mobile technologies provide all the functionalities needed to perform as a device to help teachers
                    to facilitate learning wherever the learner is. In mobile learning, the learning does not necessarily
                    happen in the classroom or at the table either: mobile devices allow users to leverage the possibilities
                    to take the device where the learning can happen most efficiently, such as gathering natural information outdoors.
                    Another aspect is the use of mobile phones in areas where schooling is hard to access for learners due 
                    to catastrophic events or long distances, rendering traditional schooling is impossible.</p>
<h3 aria-label="Subsection: 21st Century Skills" class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-1" data-aria-id="aria-83-0-6" tabindex="0">21st Century Skills</h3>
<p>There are several frameworks for 21st-century learning, with the main skills being: critical thinking,
                    problem-solving, communication, creativity and innovation, collaboration, contextual learning, ICT literacy, and
                    information management. The 21st-century skills movement emerged from the notion that more high-level
                    cognitive skills will be needed in the digitally developed world, and that education providers should
                    support students in cultivating a deeper level of knowledge and comprehension.</p>
