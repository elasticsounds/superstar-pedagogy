<p class="text-lg text-gray-800">With a decade of teaching experience, Nana educates students between 6 and 10 years old. Her expertise lies in early education, with a focus on the Akan language and mathematics. Although familiar with digital assessment in the context of older students, Nana is keen to explore its advantages for her younger learners. She has access to laptops and tablets, which could be instrumental in this endeavour.</p>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-800">However, Nana is now tasked with identifying the right pedagogical approaches to digital assessment that would best serve her students’ needs. Here, you can look at different digital pedagogy considerations with Nana, and consider which you feel would be the most important.</p>

<h3 aria-label="Consideration 1: Presentation of learning objectives" class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2" data-aria-id="aria-62-0-3" tabindex="0">Consideration 1: Presentation of learning objectives</h3>
<p>It’s essential to make learning goals clear and visible throughout the educational process.</p>
<p class="mt-2 font-semibold">Tip: Discussing and breaking down goals into smaller, manageable steps can help learners grasp them more practically.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 aria-label="Consideration 2: Digital and analogue formative assessment" class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2" data-aria-id="aria-62-0-4" tabindex="0">Consideration 2: Digital and analogue formative assessment</h3>
<p>While teachers often provide continuous verbal feedback, structured and timely feedback through digital tools can be highly beneficial.</p>
<p class="mt-2 font-semibold">Tip: Digital tools can reflect students’ self-awareness by using short questions, rewards, or other goal-related incentives.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 aria-label="Consideration 3: Formative assessment for goal refinement" class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2" data-aria-id="aria-62-0-5" tabindex="0">Consideration 3: Formative assessment for goal refinement</h3>
<p>Formative assessment can be a simple yet effective way for learners to obtain information on the learning process.</p>
<p class="mt-2 font-semibold">Tip: Utilizing this data during discussions about student progress lays a solid foundation for setting new, personalized goals informed by the learner’s own actions.</p>

<h3 aria-label="Consideration 4: Differentiation is key to catering to the varied pace of learners" class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2" data-aria-id="aria-62-0-6" tabindex="0">Consideration 4: Differentiation is key to catering to the varied pace of learners</h3>
<p>Differentiation involves making content challenging enough for faster learners, or conversely, easy enough for slower-paced learners.</p>
<p class="mt-2 font-semibold">Tip: Digital game-based learning environments often provide automated differentiation, which is vital to keep up intrinsic motivation in learners.</p>
