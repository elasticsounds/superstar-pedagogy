<p class="mb-4">Accessibility standards are guidelines and practices designed to ensure that digital
                    content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. These standards are developed
                    by international organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which develops web
                    standards like HTML, CSS, and many more. The general aim is to provide web content that is <i>Perceivable, Operable, Understandable,</i> and <i>Robust</i>.</p>

<h3 aria-label="Heading: Inclusive Education" class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2" data-aria-id="aria-75-0-4">Inclusive Education</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Inclusive education is a teaching approach that adapts to the diverse needs of all students,
                    ensuring that everyone, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds, has an equal opportunity to
                    participate in and benefit from educational experiences. It emphasizes the importance of creating
                    supportive and welcoming learning environments where differences are respected and valued. Inclusive
                    education involves modifying teaching methods, curricula, and classroom structures to meet the unique
                    needs of each student, promoting a sense of belonging and fostering social cohesion. It is a fundamental
                    right, and a means to achieve high-quality education for all.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Universal Design for learning (UDL) is an innovative approach to teaching and learning that
                    aims to provide all students with an equal opportunity to succeed. It is not about finding one way to
                    teach all students, but rather about using a variety of teaching methods to remove any barriers to
                    learning. It seeks to build in flexibility that can be adjusted for every persons strengths and
                    needs.</p>
