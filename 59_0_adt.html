<p>José Luis decides to embark on an ambitious project with his students: constructing and programming robots from a kit provided by the recent grant. Initially, José Luis had doubts about the relevance of coding in his curriculum and its perceived complexity. He worried that the abstract nature of coding might disengage his students, particularly those who struggle with math.</p>
<p>Despite his reservations, José Luis decides to proceed with the project. He leads his students through the assembly of the robots and introduces them to a user-friendly coding platform. This platform enables the students to animate their robots with various movements and tasks. To José Luis’s astonishment, the project ignites a spark of enthusiasm among the students. Some students prefer building the robots; others love to make the robots their performance circuits from cardboard. Students eagerly apply coding to direct their robots in very simple activities such as line-following and obstacle navigation. Eventually, they create a robot performance accuracy competition in student groups, where groups can name their robot and develop their secret performance code.</p>
<p>As the project unfolds, José Luis observes a seamless blend of the physical and digital worlds, revealing the intricate layers of robotics. The endeavour brings forth a wave of creativity and problem-solving skills, particularly from students who typically find maths challenging. José Luis comes to a valuable realisation: the importance of embracing mistakes as learning opportunities. He discovers that coding is not just a tool for teaching maths and logic; it’s a creative and enjoyable pathway to try out new ideas.</p>
