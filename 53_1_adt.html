<p>Aisha is intent on improving her students	 problem-solving and thinking skills with the aid of a
                    single computer and projector. Her classroom is bustling with 30 students between the ages of 10 and
                    12. She's chosen to adopt a project-based learning approach, where she presents her students with
                    real-life problems, challenging them to find solutions or, if not solutions, then to gather more
                    information about the topic.</p>
<p>She has devised a three-step plan to implement her approach. First, she aims to develop collective
                    critical thinking by using appropriate real-life examples 	 such as student-made photos from their
                    personal or family mobile devices 	 as problem statements, insightful notions, needs for improvement,
                    and points of gratitude. Second, she assists students in collaboratively finding possible solutions,
                    gathering more information about the issue, or making connections to curriculum subjects or themes.
                    Third, she ensures that the overarching objective of using digital tools to facilitate practical,
                    collaborative construction is achieved 	 a mind map, a presentation, a story, a photo collection, or
                    a collaborative expression of a thought.</p>
<p>Aisha has observed that her students are more engaged and motivated when they interact with the
                    computer and projector, and has found that the project-based learning approach is effective in her
                    classroom. The students can meaningfully apply their problem-solving and thinking skills to real-life
                    situations, learning from both each other and the various resources available to them.</p>
