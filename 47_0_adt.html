                context of social &amp; collaborative learning</h1>
<p class="mb-4">Nguyen has found that incorporating laptops into his classroom has significantly bolstered
                his students' social learning skills and overall academic performance. With a class of 38 students and
                20 laptops at his disposal, he strategically pairs students to work collaboratively on curriculum-related
                topics. Embracing a flipped learning model, Nguyen provides a variety of materials – ranging from
                traditional textbooks to digital resources and AI-generated content – allowing students to engage with
                new concepts during class. This approach not only facilitates peer-to-peer interaction, but also enables
                Nguyen to offer focused support to those who need it most.</p>
<p class="mb-4">As he observes his class, Nguyen notes a marked increase in student engagement and curiosity.
                The flipped classroom method proves to be a success, accommodating individual learning paces and
                fostering mutual assistance among students. Despite his wish for each student to have their own device,
                Nguyen occasionally allows the use of mobile phones to access pre-prepared materials, further
                personalizing the learning experience.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The use of laptops has also enhanced the students' confidence, creativity, and focus,
                particularly in problem-solving tasks and self-expression. While Nguyen ensures the availability of
                analogue materials for those who prefer them, he appreciates the quiet, digital discussions that
                technology facilitates in his large class. Pleased with the outcomes, Nguyen is committed to continuing
                the use of laptops as a tool for enriching the educational journey of his students.</p>
