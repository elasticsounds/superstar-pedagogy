                        In the realm of digital education, planning learning assessments is key, as digital tools bring
                        efficiency and vitality to the assessment process, ensuring that learners actively engage with
                        their progress.

                        Rather than limiting assessments to a final numeric scale, digital technologies enable dynamic
                        and formative assessments that align closely with learning objectives from the outset, offering
                        diverse feedback mechanisms and personalised adaptations.

                        However, the linchpin remains the teacher, whose creativity and tacit knowledge are essential in
                        seamlessly connecting learning goals, assessments, and the broader educational context, even
                        within the most advanced AI-enhanced systems.

<p tabindex="0">In this section, we will explore how digital tools can be used to assess student learning outcomes
                    and provide meaningful feedback to students and teachers. Student learning assessment with digital
                    tools can provide precise, data-driven feedback in real-time, while also introducing innovative
                    assessment approaches for a more comprehensive, meaningful experience. It is important to recognize
                    the difference, place, and mechanism of machine-based assessment and to always connect assessments
                    with the learning objectives.</p>
