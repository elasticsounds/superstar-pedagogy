<p class="mb-4">Priya will select an English learning application that is suitable for her students age group, engaging, interactive, and adaptive to individual learning needs. She will create a secure <strong>messaging group</strong> for her students, which they can access through their mobile phones or computers, to encourage group discussions and peer learning.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Together, they will establish ground rules for safe and respectful communication within the group, prohibiting bullying, spamming, swearing, and the sharing of sensitive personal information. Priya will encourage her students to use the messaging group as a space to share their experiences with the learning application, support one another, and provide feedback. She will regularly monitor the group and intervene when necessary.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Priyas aim is for her students to use English not just in the classroom, but also in their everyday lives. She will ask them to use the messaging group to share instances of how they engage with English in various contexts, such as while watching movies, listening to music, reading books, playing games, or travelling. She will also assign creative tasks that require an authentic use of English, like sharing artwork, making podcasts, or creating videos.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The students will learn to provide peer feedback and gain self-confidence. Priya anticipates that even the quieter students in the classroom will show creative and active participation in the online discussions, which will, in turn, lead to increased involvement in face-to-face interactions.</p>
