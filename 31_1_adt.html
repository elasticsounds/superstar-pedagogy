                In Marias classroom, the limited number of tablets is not a constraint, but an opportunity for targeted
                learning. As a teacher of Portuguese and music, she sees these devices as more than just incentivesthey
                are keys to unlocking a richer, more dimensional educational experience.
            </p>
<p class="mb-4">
                With only a handful of tablets available, Maria is strategic in her approach, planning to incorporate them
                into her lessons to deepen her students engagement with both subjects. She contemplates the best use of
                technology to support her teaching: which digital resources can transform the learning of Portuguese and
                music into an interactive and enjoyable journey?
            </p>
<p class="mb-4">
                How can the tablets facilitate a more profound connection with the material? Marias vision is clear: a
                lesson where each tablet is utilised with intention, guiding her students through musical and linguistic
                landscapes in a way that is both enlightening and captivating.
