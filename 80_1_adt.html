<p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">Teachers are essential in the creation of a positive learning environment
                    for students in their endeavour to make the best use of technology. As digi-tech continues to rapidly
                    evolve, it offers a myriad of benefits, opportunities, and gateways for both teachers and students.
                    Digital tools facilitate effective communication and easy access to information, as well as increase
                    student motivation, curiosity, skills, and learning outcomes. However, it is not a silver bullet;
                    rather, a tool that can enhance or hinder learning depending on the quality of the teaching and
                    associated learning processes.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">The manner in which teachers think and feel about teaching and learning
                    affects how they use technology in their classrooms. Similarly, how people both learn and perceive
                    their learning is key when using technology for education. Modern learning theories centre around two
                    main components: the first focuses on how learners interact with their surroundings, including
                    people, culture, and things. They learn new things by connecting them to what they already know. The
                    second refers to how learners use their minds, emotions, and social skills. The mind means knowledge
                    and abilities; emotions signify interest and feelings; and social skills refer to working with others.
                    As such, learning can be seen as a process of constructing meaning through social interaction and
                    shared experiences.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">Digital pedagogy merges critical elements from the realms of learning, the
                    digital environment, and the role of teachers. Academic perspectives on digital pedagogy propose a
                    thoughtful, holistic approach, where digital pedagogy is seamlessly integrated into the learning
                    process to facilitate and enrich the learner’s educational journey. Recent research suggests that
                    digital pedagogy can be understood at different levels, from the overall theoretical and personal
                    beliefs on learning (pedagogical orientation), to the specific practices (pedagogical practices), and
                    the skills required when using digital technologies to enhance learning (pedagogical competencies).
                    Consequently, reducing the concept of digital pedagogy to a singular definition is challenging;
                    nonetheless, it essentially refers to the educator’s</p>
