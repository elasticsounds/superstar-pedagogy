<p class="mb-4">Nguyen has found that incorporating laptops into his classroom has significantly bolstered his students9 social learning skills and overall academic performance. With a class of 38 students and 20 laptops at his disposal, he strategically pairs students to work collaboratively on curriculum-related topics. Embracing a flipped learning model, Nguyen provides a variety of materials 3 ranging from traditional textbooks to digital resources and AI-generated content 3 allowing students to engage with new concepts during class. This approach not only facilitates peer-to-peer interaction, but also enables Nguyen to offer focused support to those who need it most.</p>
<p class="mb-4">As he observes his class, Nguyen notes a marked increase in student engagement and curiosity. The flipped classroom method proves to be a success, accommodating individual learning paces and fostering mutual assistance among students. Despite his wish for each student to have their own device, Nguyen occasionally allows the use of mobile phones to access pre-prepared materials, further personalizing the learning experience.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The use of laptops has also enhanced the students confidence, creativity, and focus, particularly in problem-solving tasks and self-expression. While Nguyen ensures the availability of analogue materials for those who prefer them, he appreciates the quiet, digital discussions that technology facilitates in his large class. Pleased with the outcomes, Nguyen is committed to continuing the use of laptops as a tool for enriching the educational journey of his students.</p>
