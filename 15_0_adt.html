<p class="mb-4">Consideration 5: Observe machine-based (AI) automated feedback as formative assessment. It is
                important to understand how the constant automated feedback works in detail, and how it appears and
                feels to learners. <b>Tip:</b> Anticipate the learnerâ€™s emotional reaction to feedback and plan how to
                fill in the gaps of emotional or informative content from automated feedback systems.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Consideration 6: Allow humane formative assessment and peer-assessment. In addition to
                utilising technology-based assessment methods, teachers should consider the importance of including
                empathy, personal discussions, alignment with wider goals, and other humane aspects in their feedback to
                students.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><b>Tip:</b> Digital tools provide multiple possibilities for peer-assessment, and in the form
                of written feedback, the receiver has more time to process it. Digital peer-assessment can also involve
                face-to-face (F2F) discussion, i.e., digital first, followed by F2F talk or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Consideration 7: Provide students with self-assessment and self-directed learning
                opportunities. Self-assessment can be a very demanding task, but it is a valuable tool for enhancing
                self-awareness and the desire for continual learning.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><b>Tip:</b> In a digital environment, you could provide a simple questionnaire for learners to
                complete after every task. It can be a basic, emoji face-based Likert-scale assessment regarding 
                aspects.</p>
