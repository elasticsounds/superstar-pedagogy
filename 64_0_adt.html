<div class="text-gray-800">
<p>Nana was intrigued by the concept of using digital formative feedback to improve students working skills, as many students were not aware of the necessary steps required to enhance their practical learning, such as asking for assistance from classmates, or refraining from talking when it disrupts others.</p>
<p class="mt-4">She allocated a certain time of the week when, after some work, she would ask her students to fill out a very simple questionnaire about how they felt about their own work in relation to certain assignments. It was important that the students could fill out the form without needing to read. Nana used a simple version of their schools Learning Management System (LMS) to create a safe user profile for each learner. With the LMS, she also made sure that the answers to the questions referred to the correct date and assignment.</p>
<p class="mt-4">The first thing students needed to learn was how to get on board with the LMS, but immediately after the initial session, students found it easy to manage. Sometimes, the internet connection was slow, but it did not affect task performance as the tool also worked offline, seamlessly syncing the data once the connection was restored.</p>
<p class="mt-4">Nana knew that self-assessment is a very demanding task for any learner, so she needed to ensure that the questionnaire was very light and easy to complete again and again. For example, students would answer digitally to one simple question: I managed to ask for help when I needed it
 with one star (almost succeeded), two stars (yes, I did), or three stars (easily). Of course, all these sentences were also in picture format.</p>
<p class="mt-4">Within the teacher profile in the LMS, Nana was able to view the rapidly accumulating results week after week, allowing her to show students both their progress and potential obstacles. She could also show the anonymised results to the class, which was a great way to start a spontaneous discussion on the themes students were now very familiar with. This way, Nana felt that by making certain aspects of the schoolwork visible that would normally stay hidden, she could potentially prevent the development of cumulative problems or negative attitudes that could otherwise develop. Furthermore, she could more meaningfully praise the students for their positive attitude and competencies regarding their schoolwork.</p>
