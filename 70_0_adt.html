                Example in the context of learning to learn
            </h2>
<p class="text-justify leading-relaxed">
                Ahmad decided to cut every unnecessary digital tool and concentrate in using a single, simple and safe
                digital learning management system that allows him to assign tasks, set deadlines, and give feedback to
                his students. He also asked his students to use the online calendar to plan their own work, create a
                material list, and track their progress. He also explained to them how to use digital task managers -
                such as mind-maps or online whiteboards - to break down the information into manageable pieces and
                thereby assist students in organising their learning.
            </p>
<p class="mt-4 text-justify leading-relaxed">
                Ahmad is amazed by the results. He discovers that his students are more engaged and motivated in their
                learning. They can see their goals and achievements clearly, and they can rehearse managing their time,
                information, and resources effectively.
            </p>
<p class="mt-4 text-justify leading-relaxed">
                He can also see how the familiar digital environment works as a school building: it stays solid and
                provide shelter, even if the content evolves and the information changes. Ahmad can now also effectively
                identify which areas the learners really need help with, as well as provide more timely, personalized
                feedback.
