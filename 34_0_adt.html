                    In Marias classroom, the tablets became more than just tech gadgets; they were the canvas for her
                    students rhythmic and linguistic artistry. Opting for tablets was a deliberate choice, enabling the
                    recording of both video and audio  a crucial feature for the musical task at hand.
                </p>
<p class="mb-4">
                    Marias plan was simple yet effective: divide the class into three, each group mastering a unique
                    rhythm pattern. With a tablet in hand, theyd find a quiet corner to capture a one-minute
                    performance, introducing themselves, and delving into the rhythms Portuguese roots.
                </p>
<p class="mb-4">
                    Maria realized that the digital tool was essential for making the group task both possible and
                    successful, even though the tool itself was not the central part of the content. The tool enabled her
                    to capture and document the students learning process and outcome. It also motivated the students to
                    practice and perform their best, knowing they would share and watch their videos later.
                </p>
<p>
                    Tablets also facilitated spontaneous peer feedback and learning, as the students could comment and
                    learn from each others videos. Maria was amazed by the results, and so were her students. They
                    enjoyed watching and commenting on each others videos and appreciated the diversity and creativity
                    of their performances.
