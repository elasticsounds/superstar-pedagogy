                    Carlos is determined to integrate computers and a Learning Management System (LMS) into his science teaching and assessment. He envisions a classroom where digital work and hands-on activities are clearly delineated, recognising that computers may not always be available.
                </p>
<p class="mb-4">
                    Carlos plans to consult his students about their current knowledge and learning desires, and to share his expectations and criteria, which are informed by both his curriculum plans and student preferences. He intends to develop a rubric based on this collaborative input and use it to direct his instruction and feedback. The rubric will allow students to understand the objectives of each assignment, which will remain consistent, and the summative assessment will be the same for all.
                </p>
<p class="mb-4">
                    He will design assignments that require various types of work, such as researching, analysing, presenting, and creating. Carlos will assess core skills within these categories individually, in addition to traditional tests. He also plans to have students evaluate their digital skills weekly, through peer discussion and feedback, either in the LMS or face-to-face. Carlos is aware that his plan is ambitious, but he is prepared to adjust the digital components as necessary.
                </p>
<p class="mb-4">
                    What excites Carlos the most is the prospect of self-assessment and self-paced learning, which will enable learners to set their own goals and action plans based on the rubric. Each learner’s plan and self-assessment will be securely saved in the LMS. As an experienced teacher, Carlos knows that not everything may go according to plan, but he also believes that digital tools will provide essential information to form a comprehensive understanding of each student’s learning progress.
