<p data-id="text-11-9">Rachel wanted to make learning objectives clear, so she looked into the new
                    digital literacy game in detail.</p>
<p data-id="text-11-10">She was impressed by the beautiful user interface and storyline, where the
                    player learned to read gradually.</p>
<p data-id="text-11-11">The game had a personal learning path with constant feedback.</p>
<p data-id="text-11-12">She thought that children would master the game quickly on school laptops, but
                    she also planned time for them to practice using a mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p data-id="text-11-13">She knew that the game focused on recognising and reading letters and words, but
                    it was not enough to teach reading by itself.</p>
