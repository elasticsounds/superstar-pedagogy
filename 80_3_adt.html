<span data-id="text-80-20">The manner in which teachers think and feel about teaching and learning affects how they use technology in their classrooms.</span>
<span data-id="text-80-21">Similarly, how people both learn and perceive their learning is key when using technology for education.</span>
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
<span data-id="text-80-22">Modern learning theories centre around two main components:</span>
<span data-id="text-80-23">the first focuses on how learners interact with their surroundings, including people, culture, and things.</span>
<span data-id="text-80-24">They learn new things by connecting them to what they already know.</span>
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
<span data-id="text-80-25">The second refers to how learners use their minds, emotions, and social skills.</span>
<span data-id="text-80-26">The mind means knowledge and abilities;</span>
<span data-id="text-80-27">emotions signify interest and feelings;</span>
<span data-id="text-80-28">and social skills refer to working with others.</span>
<span data-id="text-80-29">As such, learning can be seen as a process of constructing meaning through social interaction and shared experiences.</span>
