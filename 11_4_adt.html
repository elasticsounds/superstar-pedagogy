<p>Rachel wanted to make learning objectives clear, so she looked into the new digital literacy game in detail. She was impressed by the beautiful user interface and storyline, where the player learned to read gradually. The game had a personal learning path with constant feedback. She thought that children would master the game quickly on school laptops, but she also planned time for them to practice using a mouse or keyboard. She knew that the game focused on recognising and reading letters and words, but it was not enough to teach reading by itself.</p>
<p>The learning objectives of the game were hidden from the learner, but Rachel soon figured them out. They involved recognising letters, forming words, and reading and writing simple sentences. She compared them with the higher curriculum level objectives, such as: Children should be able to listen attentively and respond appropriately to stories, rhymes, songs and poems in home language and additional language. She also discussed with her colleagues how they planned to integrate the game into their teaching. She decided to state the objectives by speaking for the learners, such as: Today we learn how to draw letter A in the air, taste how it sounds, and how can we recognise it. With a series of objectives like this, the curriculum master objectives would be fulfilled. After some group exercises in the classroom, she planned a digital game session with a certain letter, and let the students explore other letters further. She then stopped the game, and they reviewed together what they had learned and achieved.</p>
<p>Rachel created a simple path of objectives to reading skills, where the game was one element to reinforce learning and provide differentiation, and the other elements were the usual classroom methods. The game boosted overall enthusiasm and excitement, but also allowed faster learners to advance and slower learners to repeat. This way, Rachel did not have to give rolling feedback to all students at once, which she knew was an unrealistic goal.</p>
