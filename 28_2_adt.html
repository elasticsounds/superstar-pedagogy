<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-28-15">Samuel and Amina delve into the accessibility features of the digital
                tool, learning to adjust font sizes, contrasts, and audio descriptions, ensuring that their student with
                low vision can navigate the platform with ease.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-28-16">Samuel019s and Amina0b4s commitment to inclusivity is unwavering, as they
                believe that every child deserves equal access to the wonders of education.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-28-17">With the digital tool now thoroughly explored, Samuel uses a
                thoughtful letter to the students019 caregivers that was created in the previous term by another
                colleague.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-28-18">He makes his own additions, articulating the educational benefits and
                the safety features of the tool and emphasising its adherence to non-discriminatory practices and
                stringent privacy standards.</p>
